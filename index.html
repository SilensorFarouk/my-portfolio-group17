                    <h3></h3>
                    <p>This is a picture of our 2023 class. 4G was the best place to be among all the places I have 
                        visited in Nairobi school. This photo was taken after losing an interclass match but still
                        you can see the smiles are there and spirit of brotherhood still exists.In 4G we helped each other
                        and always cared for one another. With this class we were able to amass a lot of rewards for example
                        being awarded as the cleanest class which happened every week, the most improved class and the most 
                        disciplined class.i really miss this class which has moulded me to be who I am. 
                        .</p>

                    <h3>Impala Fest</h3>
                    <p>Impala fest is a festival held annually in The Nairobi school.The festival is important since it helps
                       nuture talents and improves self-confidence as it provides a forum where one can express themselves and
                       rough different forms of art.The impala fest also allowed motivators and great speakers visit us and
                       teach us a lot which moulds us into gentlemen.</p>
